# flatpak-builder-lint

flatpak-builder-lint is a linter for flatpak-builder manifests, and more widely,
also Flatpak builds. It is primarily developed for Flathub, but can be useful
for other Flatpak repositories.

## Installation

The only supported ways to install and use it are Flatpak and Docker.

### Flatpak

flatpak-builder-lint is part of the `org.flatpak.Builder` flatpak package
available on Flathub. [Set up Flatpak][flatpak_setup] first, then install
`org.flatpak.Builder`:

```bash
flatpak install flathub -y org.flatpak.Builder
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder --help

# Run the manifest check
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest com.foo.bar.json

# Run the repo check
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder repo repo
```

The Flatpak package tracks the git commit currently used on the Flathub
infrastructure.

### Docker

The latest build of flatpak-builder-linter can be used with Docker.

```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest --help

# Run the manifest check
docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest manifest /mnt/com.foo.bar.json

# Run the repo check
docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt --rm -it ghcr.io/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint:latest repo /mnt/repo
```

You may need to pass `:Z` if your distro is using SELinux like so
`-v $(pwd):/mnt:Z`.

### Local environment

Installing flatpak-builder-lint locally with [Poetry][poetry] or pip is
not recommended unless for development purposes. It depends on patches
that are found in the `org.flatpak.Builder` flatpak package
and on external tools.

## Contributing

The following system dependencies must be installed:

- `libgirepository1.0-dev, gir1.2-ostree-1.0`
- `flatpak-builder` for validating flatpak-builder manifests
- `appstreamcli` from `org.flatpak.Builder` for validating MetaInfo files
```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec flatpak run --branch=stable --command=appstreamcli org.flatpak.Builder ${@}
```
- `desktop-file-validate` to validate desktop files
- `git` to check if a directory is a git repository

Debiab/Ubuntu:

```
# apt install git appstream flatpak-builder libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-ostree-1.0 libcairo2-dev desktop-file-utils
```

ArchLinux:

```
# pacman -S --needed git appstream flatpak-builder desktop-file-utils ostree glib2
```

Fedora:

```
# dnf install git appstream flatpak-builder desktop-file-utils ostree-libs glib2-devel cairo-devel
```

Then the project can be installed with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint.git && cd flatpak-builder-lint
poetry install
poetry run flatpak-builder-lint --help
```

After making changes to any dependencies run
`poetry lock --no-update` to regenerate the lockfile and
`poetry install --sync` to synchronise the virtual environment when
chaning code or dependencies.

The virtual enviroment can be listed with `poetry env list` and removed
with `poetry env remove flatpak-builder-lint-xxxxxxxx-py3.xx`.

The following Python dependencies are installed by Poetry and needed to
run `jsonschema^4.19.1, requests^2.32.2, requests-cache^1.2.1, lxml^5.2.2,
sentry-sdk^2.8.0, PyGObject^3.48.2`. Additionally `poetry-core>=1.0.0`
is necessary to build.

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/) is used to lint and
format code. [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
is used to check Python types. To run them:

```sh
# Formatting
poetry run ruff format .

# Linting
poetry run ruff check .

# Auto fix some lint errrors
poetry run ruff check --fix .

# Check python types
poetry run mypy .
```

A pre-commit hook is provided to automate the formatting and linting:

```
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Uninstall hooks
poetry run pre-commit uninstall
```

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html) is used
to run tests:

```sh
poetry run pytest -v tests
```

An additional Flat manager test can be run when modifying code relying
on the flatmanager check using

```sh
./tests/flatmanager.sh
```
